          If you choose to delete or deactivate any Paid Services prior to the
          period for which it is active, we will not be liable to refund you for
          any unutilized time. In the event you are not able to avail of the
          Paid Services on the Website on account of any technical reasons, on
          receipt of payment confirmation, equivalent units of the paid feature
          against the ad units you were not able to post shall be credited to
          your account. For example, if you buy a package of 3 Featured Ad units
          out of which you have consumed only 2 units and were unable to post
          the remaining 1 ad unit as a Featured Ad on account of a technical
          glitch during the lifetime of the package validity, you will be
          credited only 1 unit of Featured Ad to your account.

          your advertisement is deleted or not re-posted on the Website on
          account of any technical reasons due to any subsequent editing done by
