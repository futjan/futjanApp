          Using FutJan is generally free, but we sometimes charge a fee for
          certain services. If the service you use incurs a fee, you'll be able
          to review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time
          you post your ad. Our fees are quoted in Pounds Sterling, and we may
          change them from time to time. We'll notify you of changes to our fee
          policy by posting such changes on FutJan. We may choose to temporarily
          change our fees for promotional events or new services; these changes
          are effective when we announce the promotional event or new service.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You are responsible for paying the FutJan fees when they're due. If
          you don't, without prejudice to any other right or remedy we may be
          entitled to under these Terms of Use or by law, we may limit your
          ability to use the services. If your payment method fails or your
          account is past due, we may collect fees owed using other collection
          mechanisms.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You acknowledge that your ads may be deleted from FutJan in case we
          believe these Terms of Use, including our Posting Rules, are breached,
          either directly or indirectly. In case you would have paid a fee for
          the display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee.
          However, we reserve the right not to refund FutJan users for any fees
          paid through use of FutJan in the following cases:
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If you breach, in our opinion, these Terms of Use, which include,
          without limitation, the Policies;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If your ads went live with exposure on the FutJan sites, services,
          applications or tools, even for a limited time, and that they
          benefited from the service associated with the paid fee;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If your ads are placed in the Pets or Massage categories of FutJan;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If your ads are placed into "edit" mode and will go live to site once
          updated by you;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>If you have removed your ads yourself;</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If you post duplicate ads as defined in our rules regarding duplicate
          ads;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If we believe that your ads are in a significantly wrong category;
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          In addition to the FutJan services, ancillary goods or services such
          as insurance or car finance may be advertised on FutJan. Although
          users may offer financial products on their ads, FutJan is in no way
          involved or liable for any loss related to such transactions.
