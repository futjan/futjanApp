        FutJan grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to access
        and use the Service for personal use. This license granted herein does
        not include any of the following: (a) access to or use of the Service by
        Posting Agents; or (b) any collection, aggregation, copying,
        duplication, display, or derivative use of the Service nor any use of
        data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction
        tools for any purpose unless expressly permitted by FutJan or as
        otherwise set forth in these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
        general purpose internet search engines and non-commercial public
        archives that gather information for the sole purpose of displaying
        hyperlinks to the Service, provided they each do so from a stable IP
        address or range of IP addresses using an easily identifiable agent and
        comply with our robots.txt file, may engage in the activities set forth
        in (b). For purposes of this exception, a "general purpose internet
        search engine" does not include a website or search engine or other
        services that specializes in classified listings including any subset of
        classifieds listings such as Surplus, for sale, jobs, services, or
        personals, or which otherwise provides classified ad listing services.
        The license set forth in this Section permits you to display on your
        website, or create a hyperlink thereto, individual postings on the
        Service so long as such use is for non-commercial and/or news reporting
        purposes only (e.g., for use in personal blogs or other personal online
        media). If the total number of such postings displayed on or linked to
        your website exceeds limits set by FutJan, your use will be considered
        to be in violation of these Terms, unless FutJan expressly grants you
        permission otherwise. You are also permitted to create a hyperlink to
        the home page of the Platform so long as the link does not portray
        FutJan, its employees, affiliates, or agents in a false, confusing,
        misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter. Use of the
        Service beyond the scope of authorized access as set forth in these
        Terms immediately terminates any permission or license granted herein.
        In order to collect, aggregate, copy, duplicate, display or make
        derivative use of the Service or any Content made available via the
        Service for other purposes (including commercial purposes) not stated
        herein, you must first obtain a license from FutJan.
