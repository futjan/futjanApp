            FutJan is generally free, but we sometimes charge a fee for certain
            services. If the service you use incurs a fee, you'll be able to
            review and accept terms that will be clearly disclosed at the time
            you post your ad. Our fees are quoted in currency you select, and we
            may change them from time to time. We'll notify you of changes to
            our fee policy by posting such changes on FutJan. We may choose to
            temporarily change our fees for promotional events or new services;
            these changes are effective when we announce the promotional event
            or new service.

            venue to allow our users who comply with these Terms to offer, sell,
            and buy products and services listed on the Platform. Although you
            may be able to conduct payment and other transactions through the
            Platform, using third-party vendors such as FutJan is not in any way
            involved in such transactions. As a result, and as discussed in more
            detail in these Terms, you hereby acknowledge and agree that FutJan
            is not a party to such transactions, has no control over any element
            of such transactions, and shall have no liability to any party in
