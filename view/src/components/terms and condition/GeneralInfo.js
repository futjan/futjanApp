        These Terms and the other policies posted on the Platform constitute the
        complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and
        FutJan and govern your use of the Service and the Platform superseding
        all prior understandings, proposals, agreements, negotiations, and
        discussions between the parties, whether written or oral. The Terms and
        the relationship between you and FutJan shall be governed by the laws of
        the India. Any claim you may have against FutJan must be submitted to
        the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of India. However, in the event
        that you are a consumer, it may be that consumer law requires that
        another law is applicable and that a claim may be submitted to another
        jurisdiction. The failure of FutJan to exercise or enforce any right or
        provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
        provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid (including, without limitation,
        because such provision is inconsistent with the laws of another
        jurisdiction) or inapplicable, the parties nevertheless agree that the
        court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as
        reflected in the provision. If any provision or provisions of these
        Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity,
        legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Terms
        shall not in any way be affected or be impaired. You agree that any
        cause of action brought by you and arising out of or related to your use
        of the service and/or the platform must commence within a reasonable
        time and in any event within one (1) year after the cause of action
        accrues, except that FutJan may commence any such cause of action in
        accordance with the applicable statute of limitations under Indian law.
        Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. These terms shall
        inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each party's successors and
        assigns.
