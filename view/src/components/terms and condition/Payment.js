          Upon selecting any feature of Paid Services, you may be redirected to
          a third-party payment processing site such as PayU offering payment
          through various channels such as net banking, debit card and credit
          card (“Payment Gateway”). FUTJAN may offer you a right to pay through
          cash or other channels such as cash collection. You agree that Paid
          Services will be made available to you only upon receipt of payment
          confirmation from the Payment Gateway or collection agencies. Upon
          making payment to us, through any medium whatsoever, you warrant to us
          that you are entitled to use the medium or otherwise make the payment
          to us under applicable law.

        <li>
          You have the ability to provide us your Goods and Services Tax
          Identification Number (GSTIN) on the platform. Your GSTIN details are
          mandatory for passing on the credit of GST charged. In case you fail
          to provide us with your GSTIN details, we will assume that you are not
          registered with the GST authorities, without independently verifying
          your registration status.
