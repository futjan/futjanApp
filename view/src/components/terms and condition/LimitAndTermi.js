        You acknowledge and agree that FutJan may establish limits from time to
        time concerning the use of the Service, including among others, the
        maximum number of days that Content will be maintained or retained by
        the Service, the maximum number and size of postings, e-mail messages,
        or other Content that may be transmitted or stored by the Service, and
        the frequency and the manner in which you may access the Service or the
        Platform. You acknowledge that your account is identified and linked
        through your mobile number, Facebook account, or email address through
        which you have registered. In the event you have more than one account
        linked through your mobile number, Facebook account, or email address,
        FutJan reserves the right to remove or restrict the usage of such
        duplicate accounts. You acknowledge and agree that FutJan has no
        responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any
        Content maintained or transmitted by the Platform or the Service. You
        acknowledge and agree that FutJan reserves the right at any time to
        modify, limit or discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) with or
        without notice and that FutJan shall not be liable to you or to any
        third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance of
        the Service. You acknowledge and agree that FutJan, in its sole and
        absolute discretion, has the right (but not the obligation) to delete or
        deactivate your account, block your e-mail or IP address, or otherwise
        terminate your access to or use of the Service (or any part thereof),
        immediately and without notice, and remove and discard any Content
        within the Service, for any reason or no reason at all, including,
        without limitation, if FutJan believes that you have violated these
        Terms. Further, you agree that FutJan shall not be liable to you or any
        third-party for any termination of your access to the Platform or the
        Service. Further, you agree not to attempt to use the Service after any
        such termination.
